##Abstract:   
This study aims to explore the relationship of social media on mental health and understand the mechanism that makes it harmful to some.  By exploring the various components of social media effect on the brain to identify the triggers that lead to addiction and negative mental health outcomes, the study proposes replicating other activities on social media that activate the same region of the brain, but have fewer negative impacts on mental health. This involves building a high-fidelity mobile app prototype that encompasses these new activities made to improve mental health relations with social media. The app draws on research in psychology, neuroscience, and human computer interaction to create a positive social media experience that enhances mental wellbeing. In particular, it focuses on remodeling social media “feed”, time spend, interaction with other users and intention of the app itself. Overall, this study aims to develop new strategies for improving the mental health and social media outcomes by having a better understanding of social media's impact on the brain to create a more positive social media experience.
